# student-record-system


This is a program for student record management in C language: 
• Data structures: It has a structure for storing the details of students. 
• File Handling: It stores student's records in a file and provides functions for adding, 
searching, viewing and deleting records. 
• Terminal output: It displays the output in the terminal and has a good interface for 
the user. 
• Binary file: It uses binary files instead of text files to store the data of students which 
are more efficient as they take less place and are more secure than general text 
files. 
• Text colour: We have added colour to the text in the printed statements using ANCI 
colour codes. 
• Data Accuracy: The program is built so that the data entered would be evaluated if 
data belongs to the valid data type.
